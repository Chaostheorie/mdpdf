# First Heading

## Second Heading

### Third Heading

This is some content that contains inline _italics_, **bold**, and `code fn()`.

But mdpdf also supports ~~strikethrough~~.

You can organise your projects with todolists (broken ATM):

-   [ ] But
-   [x] This
-   [ ] Is
-   [x] not
-   [ ] the
-   [x] end

Or take notes with unordered or ordered lists:

-   notes
-   are
-   mandatory

1. order
2. is
3. absolute

| Tables | are      | supported | too                 |
| ------ | -------- | --------- | ------------------- |
| In     | addition | too       | 'smart punctuation' |

```python
def function():
    return "Hello World!"

# and syntax highlighted code blocks

if __name__ ==  "__main__":
    print("That features extensive support")
```

> There's also blockquotes
>
> > That even support
> >
> > > Nesting

Breaking with `<div class="break"></div>`:
