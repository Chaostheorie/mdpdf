# mdpdf

mdpdf is a simple CLI tool to convert [commonmark](https://commonmark.org/) files to PDF files. It leverages [pulldown-cmark](https://github.com/raphlinus/pulldown-cmark), [syntect](https://github.com/trishume/syntect) as well as [ammonia](https://github.com/rust-ammonia/ammonia) and [wkhtmltopdf](https://wkhtmltopdf.org/) to provide a complete experience. This includes syntax highlighting and extensions such as tables, taskslists, strikethorugh or footnotes.

> Only linux is supported for building ATM though you may be able to cross compile for windows etc.

## Building

The build process is at the moment only tested on debian. You will need to build wkhtmlpdf first. See their [packaging repository](https://github.com/wkhtmltopdf/packaging) for instructions. It's required to have [GNU bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) installed though you may launch the make commands from another terminal emulator.

You will also need [GNU Grep](https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/), [GNU Coreutils (for stat)](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/coreutils.html), [GNU make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) and npm.

Just run: `make build`

To build a debian package run `make deb` instead.

This uses [bootstrap 5](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap) for styling and may embed a part of their code in the binary. The license for bootstrap is [found here](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/main/LICENSE).
