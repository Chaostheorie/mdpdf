# mdpdf

mdpdf is a simple cli tool to convert markdown files to pdf files. It leverages [comrak]() and [wkhtmltopdf]() to enable you to either use the included css files or customize your pdfs.

## Building

The build process is at the moment only tested on debian. You will need to build wkhtmlpdf first. See their [packaging repository](https://github.com/wkhtmltopdf/packaging) for instructions.
